# Rat Deterrent Sounds

This folder contains audio files specifically chosen to deter rats and other rodents from your property.

## Effective Rat Deterrent Sounds

1. **Ultrasonic Frequencies** (18-40 kHz)
   - High-frequency sounds that are uncomfortable for rodents
   - Humans typically can't hear frequencies above 20 kHz

2. **Predator Sounds**
   - Cat meowing and growling
   - Owl hoots and screeches
   - Snake hissing sounds
   - Dog barking

3. **Distress Calls**
   - Rat alarm calls from other rats
   - Mouse distress squeaks
   - General rodent warning sounds

4. **Environmental Sounds**
   - Metal clanging or banging
   - Sharp clicking sounds
   - Sudden loud noises

## File Format
- Use .wav format for best compatibility
- 16-bit, 44.1kHz sample rate recommended
- Keep files under 30 seconds for quick response

## Usage
Place .wav or .mp3 files in this directory. The system will automatically detect and make them available for selection in the countermeasures settings.

## Effectiveness Notes
- Rats can become accustomed to repeated sounds
- Rotate between different deterrent sounds for best results
- Combine with physical deterrents for maximum effectiveness
- Ultrasonic sounds work best but may not work through walls
