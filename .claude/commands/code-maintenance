Review the codebase for quality issues and maintenance needs. Specifically check for:

Code Quality Issues:
- Inconsistencies in naming conventions, formatting, or coding patterns
- Placeholder code, TODOs, FIXMEs, or temporary implementations
- Obvious bugs or logic errors
- Code smells like duplicate code, overly complex functions, or dead code
- Unused imports, variables, or functions
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Missing or inadequate error handling

Documentation & Standards:
- Violations of guidelines specified in claude.md
- Missing or outdated documentation
- Unclear variable/function names that need clarification
- Missing type annotations where applicable

Performance & Security:
- Potential performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities or unsafe practices
- Resource leaks or inefficient algorithms

For each issue found, provide:
1. File path and line number
2. Description of the issue
3. Suggested fix or improvement
4. Priority level (high/medium/low)

Start with the most critical issues first.
